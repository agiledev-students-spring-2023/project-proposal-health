# Project Proposal

## Project Title
hEAlTh (The Healthy Eating Program)

## What and Why?
Web app or phone app. This is a healthy eating app, that allows the user to set up personalized foods or types of foods and the limits for said foods. How many times they can be eaten a day/week/month. 
The idea solves the problem for VERY specific health/eating/nutriotion plans, allowing the user to set their personal plan and limits, contrary to other apps. The app would not track calories or other types of specific details per food, since the idea is to support a plan already made by a professional. In future updates it could include calorie/sugars/etc values as well. 

## For Whom?
Anyone who wants to set a healthy eating plan with a professional and have an easy way of keeping up with it. Or someone who has a plan for themselves but needs a way to track it. 

## How?
The program will initially prompt the user to initiate their plan by entering their food options and limits daily, weekly and monthly. From then, every time the user eats they would register to which categories the eaten foods would count on as eaten. Every day the dailies are reset, every week the weeklies are reset and every month the monthlies are reset. The user may request a report of the past week (for dailies), month (for weeklies) and overall for everything, detailing how many times and for which specific food they have gone over the limit, or below the required consumption of a specific food group, as well as the average eaten daily, weekly or monthly. This information can be used when speaking with whoever worked the plan to alter it as necessary, something the user will be able to do in the settings optin (alter every food, limit, requirements, etc.)

## Scope
The project would need a lot of implementation for the basic database and the management of said database, interpretation of the information, etc. The creation of the features and the implementation of the graphics for the application.
